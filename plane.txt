Need to create vscode plugin that simplfies the asop buiding process just like we buiding apps in android studio

1) need to create run configations just like android studio for asop
2) it should take aosp root path
3) it should take target using dropdown based on aosp root path
4) it should take device using dropdown based on adb devices
5) it should have build variant (user, userdebug, eng)
6) It should take environment variables used in asop build process
7) It should have option to to select module to build and path to build
8) It should have option to select build type (clean, incremental, full)
9) It should have option to build only or build and download using scp to local destination or build and push to device using adb push or install using adb install
